# Snake Game

*This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Java using Swing.*

## Description

*The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board eating food pellets. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, making it more challenging to avoid collisions with the walls of the game board or the snake's own body. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.*
