# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Java using Swing.

## Description

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board eating food pellets. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, making it more challenging to avoid collisions with the walls of the game board or the snake's own body. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls using arrow keys.
- Random generation of food pellets on the game board.
- Display of the current score and game over message.
- Responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes.
